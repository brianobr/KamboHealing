About kambo section 

Bioactive Peptides in Kambo

Kambo contains a unique blend of bioactive peptides, which are naturally occurring compounds that interact with receptors in the body, influencing the immune, nervous, endocrine, and cardiovascular systems. While research is ongoing, here are some of the most studied peptides present in Kambo:

Dermorphin & Deltorphin
    •    Bind to opiate receptors (μ and δ)
    •    Involved in modulating pain and stress response
    •    Important: These peptides do not cause euphoria or a high, and are not addictive

Phyllocaerulein
    •    Stimulates smooth muscle and bile secretion
    •    May support digestion and gastrointestinal cleansing

Phyllokinin & Phyllomedusin
    •    Vasodilators that expand blood vessels
    •    May increase permeability and circulation, aiding detox and nutrient delivery

Sauvagine
    •    Affects adrenal function and the HPA axis
    •    May help the body regulate stress and inflammatory response

Adenoregulin
    •    Modulates the adenosine system
    •    Linked to energy metabolism, sleep cycles, and cellular communication

Tryptophyllins (T-2 and others)
    •    Less understood, but may play antimicrobial or regulatory roles
    •    Being studied for immune signaling and neuroactive potential

Deltorphin A & B
    •    Selective δ-opioid receptor agonists
    •    Show high receptor affinity, potentially aiding pain modulation without CNS sedation

Dermaseptins
    •    A family of antimicrobial peptides
    •    Known to break down pathogens like bacteria, fungi, and protozoa on contact

B2 and B3 Peptides
    •    Under ongoing study for anti-cancer, antimicrobial, or metabolic effects
    •    Thought to enhance cellular defense mechanisms

Why It Matters

Unlike pharmaceuticals that target a single system, Kambo’s peptides may act synergistically, supporting a reset of the body’s own regulatory processes. The secretion is absorbed through the lymphatic system, allowing a wide range of systemic effects without entering the bloodstream directly.


Honoring the Roots of Kambo

Kambo comes from the traditions of indigenous Amazonian tribes such as the Matsés, Katukina, and Yawanawá, who have worked with the secretion of the Phyllomedusa bicolor frog for generations. While modern use has expanded beyond the rainforest, it’s important to honor the origins of this practice with humility and respect.

Responsible Practice

The frogs are carefully handled and released unharmed after their secretion is collected, a process done without injury, in accordance with indigenous methods. This respectful relationship ensures sustainability and preserves the integrity of the tradition.

Informed Space

While this offering is rooted in indigenous practices, it’s adapted to modern needs, blending traditional structure with a focus on safety, preparation, and integration. Each session is held in an intentional space that supports personal growth and deep release
