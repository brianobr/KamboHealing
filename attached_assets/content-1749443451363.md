###### Indigneous Amazonian wisdom meets modern day medical technology

## What is **Kambo**?

Kambo is a traditional Amazonian medicine that has been used for centuries by various indigenous tribes located in the Amazon basin of South America. Kambo comes from the skin secretions of the “Giant Monkey Frog” or _Phyllomedusa Bicolour._ The frogs are released unharmed after the secretion is collected.

The secretion contains dozens of bio-active peptide compounds that show present potent anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and immune-modulating effects. Many of these scientifically-studied peptides have dramatic effects on neurological, vascular, immunological and gastrointestinal systems in humans. Kambo is _**Legal**_ and _**Safe**_ when administered by a qualified practitioner.

**###### Unveiling the Remarkable Kambo Experiences of Our Valued Clients**

**## Resounding **Testimonials****

**When I first met Caitlin, I had been struggling with Epstein Barr Virus for nearly 6 months. When all other remedies failed, I flew to San Diego to work with Caitlin. After just two Kambo sessions with her, my sickness went into remission and has never returned. It’s been three years since my first Kambo session and I am still feeling vibrant and healthy.**

**Caitlin is a sensitive healer, with expert knowledge of Kambo and its unique properties. I am forever grateful to have found her!**

****Andrea Daerice****

**What I found most appealing about Caitlin is that her background in science as well as her dedication to the spiritual path gives her a unique and holistic understanding of the medicine that I don’t often find in these alternative/spiritual-based healing modalities. She also healed herself from an auto-immune disorder similar to mine which gave me an extra confidence in the medicine, as well as her as a practitioner of it and her sincere empathy and understanding of my situation. My sessions with her have been great – I feel very held by someone I have deep trust and respect for. After the sessions I feel very content and at ease emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually. I highly recommend working with her if you value a practitioner who has explored deep into spiritual realms and understands the science behind the medicine**

**Caitlin helped steward me through a life and health changing event in 2018. Kambo turned out to be just what I needed! Caitlin was caring and professional every step of the way.
