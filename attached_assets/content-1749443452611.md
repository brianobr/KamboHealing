### Hi, I'm Ruby Fremon

If you’re seeking a seasoned and compassionate Coach, Mentor, and Spiritual Guide to support you in creating a deeply meaningful life, and you’re not afraid of hearing the uncomfortable truths, I’m here.

You’re purpose-driven and you know you’re here to serve in meaningful ways, but you’re showing up as a diluted version of yourself. You find yourself holding back and often obsess over how you’re being seen. Your commitment to your personal growth is obvious, yet your wounds and trauma continue to resurface which prevents you from fully stepping into your Dharma. You feel spiritually disconnected and weighed down by all that life demands of you, which makes it difficult for you to have faith and experience joy in your life and leadership.

You are living out of alignment with God, your truth, and your Dharma. That’s why I’m here.

I want you to have a life where you feel free in every way. I want you to embrace all parts of yourself–the dark, the light, and the shadowy spaces in between. I want you to lead your Dharma with absolute clarity and conviction. I want you to build your life and legacy in full alignment with your truth. I want you to be successful on your own terms. I want you to feel the breadth of support that comes through God’s love. I want you to experience the joy that comes through true spiritual liberation. I want you to stop diluting who you are and start owning your potency.

### THE BOOK  POTENT LEADERSHIP

In today’s online culture, it’s easy to confuse “influencers” with leaders, and chase the followers, the likes, and the superficial success. But while influencers paint a pretty picture, real leaders pave a path. Leadership isn’t about what you do, nor is it about what you’ve accomplished.

It’s about who you be.
